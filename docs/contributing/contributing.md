Currently, many of our problems do not have full editorials and only use one method of solving. You can help by adding editorials, solutions, comments, and just improving the content in general. 

In order to get started, first clone the [Github repository](https://github.com/United-Coding-Tournament/archive). 
You can do so by running 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/United-Coding-Tournament/archive
```
in your terminal. 

Once you have the source in your local machine, navigate to the `archives` folder which contains Markdown files for all our pages.

After making your changes, feel free to open a PR!
