# Contributing

Currently, many of our problems do not have full editorials and only use one method of solving. You can help by adding editorials, solutions, comments, and just improving the content in general. 

In order to get started, first fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/United-Coding-Tournament/archive). 

Once you have the source in your local machine, navigate to the `archives` folder which contains Markdown files for all our pages.

After making your changes, feel free to open a PR! 

## Notes 

- Please write good commit messages and add commit descriptions that explain the changes you made, and \*why* you made those changes. 

- When adding code solutions, make sure that they are well formatted (consistent).
